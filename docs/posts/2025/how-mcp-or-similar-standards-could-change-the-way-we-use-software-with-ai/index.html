      MCP (or similar standards) Could Change the Way We Use Software
      with AI</h1>
      <p>I think many of my colleagues here at <a
      href="https://dinero.dk/">Dinero</a> will agree when I say I’ve
      been <em>deep down the MCP-server rabbit hole</em> lately 🕳️😅</p>
      <p>I’ve spent quite a bit of time trying to understand MCP
      servers, public opinions around the standard, and—most
      importantly—how it might shape the way we use software in the
      future.</p>
      <p>And now many of you might be asking:</p>
      <p><strong>What the heck is an MCP server? 🤔</strong></p>
      <p>Here’s my best explanation so far:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p><strong>MCP is a standardized frontend for AI
      agents.</strong></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>I’ve created a diagram to illustrate how I imagine MCP servers
      might impact the future of software usage.</p>
      <p>Below is a brief walkthrough of the diagram 👇</p>

      <p>Users interact manually with each system (Salesforce, HubSpot,
      Zendesk) via individual frontends. Everything relies on human
      contextual understanding and manual navigation.</p>
      <hr />
      <h2 id="𝗣𝗼𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗮𝗹-𝗙𝘂𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲-𝟭">𝗣𝗼𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗮𝗹 𝗙𝘂𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝟭</h2>
      <p>Users talk to a single AI agent, which uses MCP servers to
      interact with various platforms. No more jumping between systems.
      The AI understands the task, and the MCP servers ensure the AI
      agent can interface with and understand each system.</p>
      <hr />
      <h2 id="𝗣𝗼𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗮𝗹-𝗙𝘂𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲-𝟮">𝗣𝗼𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗮𝗹 𝗙𝘂𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝟮</h2>
      <p>Users still only interact with one AI agent. However, this
      agent communicates with an MCP <strong>core</strong>, which
      delegates tasks to specialized AI agents for each system. This
      enables an even more intelligent and modular approach, where tasks
      are handled by <em>experts</em> (AI agents) for each system—like a
      team of specialists orchestrated behind the scenes.</p>
      <hr />
      <p>If you buy into this, several interesting questions remain in
      the “Potential Future 2” scenario: - Who will build and own the AI
      agent broker? - Will it be controlled by a single company or
      developed collaboratively by multiple players? - Will it be
      open-source or proprietary? - Will software companies in the
      future need to build an AI agent interface for their products—just
      as they do today for desktop and mobile? - What’s the incentive
      for companies to contribute agents to a shared broker? - Who
      decides which agent gets delegated a task—and on what basis? -
      Will brokers develop “preferences” or bias towards certain
      agents?</p>
