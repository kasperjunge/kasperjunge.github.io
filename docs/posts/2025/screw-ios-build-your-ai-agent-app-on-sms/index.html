      Build Your AI Agent App on SMS</h1>
      <p>What will be the next big platform for the emerging interface
      weâ€™re starting to see with AI agents and standards like <a
      href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol">MCP</a>?
      ðŸ¤”</p>
      <p>Will it be ChatGPT, iOS, Android, Claude, Chrome, etc.?</p>
      <p>Actually, we can zoom out even further.</p>
      <p>Because the new interface is language.</p>
      <p>That means anything capable of exchanging text messages or
      voice can serve as a platform for this new interface.</p>
      <p>In principle, you could give iOS the finger and build your AI
      agent app over SMS and phone calls.</p>
