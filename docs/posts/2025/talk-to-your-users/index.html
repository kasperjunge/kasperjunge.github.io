      <p>If you want to win when you build software, practice this one
      simple thing:</p>
      <p>Talk to your users.</p>
      <p>You’ll be surprised how few companies actually talk to their
      users.</p>
      <p>It might be the biggest unfair advantage you can get with the
      smallest possible effort.</p>
      <p>You just have to do it.</p>
      <p>Talk to your users.</p>
      <p>It shouldn’t be an unfair advantage.</p>
      <p>But it is.</p>
      <p>Because even though everyone should be doing it, no one is
      doing it.</p>
      <p>And actually, you shouldn’t just talk to your users.</p>
      <p>You should be obsessed with talking to your users.</p>
      <p>Never fool yourself into thinking you know what your users’
      problems are.</p>
      <p>You don’t.</p>
      <p>The only way to learn is by talking to your users.</p>
      <p>So talk to your users.</p>
