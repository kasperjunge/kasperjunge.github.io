      <h1 id="why-are-people-still-using-text">Why Are People Still
      Using Text?</h1>
      <p>For quite some time I’ve been thinking about why we humans
      still use text as a medium of storing, transmitting adn receiving
      language information.</p>
      <p>In every way speech via audio seems like a more rich, pleasant,
      efficient and natural way for humans to process language
      information.</p>
      <p>Humans learn speech, before they learn to read.</p>
      <p>When we transmit language information via speech, the only
      thing we need to occupy is our voice to speak. When we transmit
      language information via text, we both need to occupy our hands
      for writing or typing and our vision to see what we’re doing.</p>
      <p>When we receive language information via speech we need to use
      our ears. When we receive language information via text we need to
      use our eyes. But with text, there seem to be a lot more friction
      involved to actually recieve language information.</p>
      <p>Audio for recording speech has been invented for many
      years.</p>
      <p>None the less, people in modern society is still heavy users of
      text as a medium for language information and in many cases prefer
      it over voice.</p>
      <p>In this essay I will dig into why people are still using text
      even though speech via audio seems to be more compelling and
      increasingly available in technology. Also, I will speculate and
      reflect on what the future holds for speech-based use of
      technology.</p>
      <p>Observations - Text enable visual overview of language
      information. - Text occupies hands and sight when trasmitting
      language information. Speech only occupies the voice. - Text
      allows the transmitter to be more in-control of the language
      information they want to transmit, before transmitting it, beacuse
      it can be edited, saved, delelted, shared for review, iterated on.
      - More work is required to recieve language inforamtion via text
      compared to speech. - When using software, some tasks are better
      suited for at textual-visual based UI and current software has a
      strong bias towards those solutions, because that is the only
      thing that has been feaisble to solv for, before generative LLMs
      got good. - Many people think that it is akward to talk to their
      software, when they are in public spaces. Also, the language
      information people want to transmit might be private and thus
      inapproriate to speak out loud on the bus or in the train while
      commuting.</p>
      <h2 id="the-first-use-case-of-text">The first use-case of
      text</h2>
      <p>A couple of words on my understanding of the first use-case of
      text.</p>
      <p>The first known use case of text was accounting on clay tablets
      by the Sumerians about 5,000 years ago. The problem text solved
      there was the storage of information to keep track of who traded
      what and who owned what.</p>
      <p>Keeping track of ownership became essential, because as groups
      of people living together grew from tens, to hundreds, to
      thousands, it was no longer possible to rely on memory alone to
      know who owned what. The first reason being that it was simply not
      possible for peopel to remeber all that infomration. Secondly
      people also did not fully trust each other to simply “remember”
      ownership correctly. So text offered a more reliable source of
      truth. By writing ownership down on clay tablets, they could
      always point to a shared reference that everyone agreed on.</p>
      <p>At the same time, recording trade transactions had great
      practical value. Trade was not just about who owned something at a
      given moment, but about exchanges that changed ownership. When
      person A gave grain to person B in return for livestock, the act
      of writing down the transaction created accountability: it
      provided evidence of what had been promised or delivered, made it
      possible to settle disputes, and supported more complex systems of
      credit, debt, and taxation. Recording trade enabled societies to
      coordinate economic activity at a larger scale than oral
      agreements could support.</p>
      <p>So, the first utilities of text seem to have been humans being
      concerned both with proving that they owned something and with
      ensuring that exchanges of goods and resources were fairly
      documented. In many ways it seems like text was an important
      technology that was required in order to scale human
      civilisation.</p>
      <h2 id="the-first-use-case-of-recorded-speech">The first use-case
      of recorded speech</h2>
      <p>A couple of words on my understanding of the first use-case of
      recorded speech.</p>
      <p>The invention of recorded speech came much later than text,
      only about 150 years ago with the phonograph developed by Thomas
      Edison in 1877. The first problem it solved was not the need for
      accounting or ownership, but rather the desire to capture the
      sound of human voices and performances — moments that until then
      could only be experienced live and then disappeared.</p>
      <p>The first recordings were often of music, songs, or spoken
      recitations. For the first time in history, people could listen
      again and again to the same performance, independent of time and
      place. This was revolutionary because it allowed emotional,
      artistic, and cultural expression to be preserved and distributed
      far beyond the limitations of memory or presence.</p>
      <p>Another early use-case was preserving the voices of important
      people. Families, institutions, and governments realized that the
      technology could serve as a way to “immortalize” speech — to hear
      not just what someone said, but exactly how they said it. In that
      sense, recorded speech became a supplement to text: where text
      preserved content, audio preserved tone, emotion, and nuance.</p>
      <p>So, the first utilities of recorded speech seem to have been
      humans being concerned with preserving experiences, culture, and
      memory in a way that went beyond the written word. It was less
      about scaling administration and trade, and more about capturing
      the human voice as a living trace of presence.</p>
      <p>Perfect, let’s boil it right down to the core utilities for
      sender (transmitter) and receiver at each stage. No tech details,
      no cultural framing — just what did the individual gain.</p>
      <p>Text • ~3200 BCE • Sender: Fixes claim of ownership/trade in a
      trusted medium. • Receiver: Reliable reference of agreements and
      rights. • ~2000 BCE • Sender: Preserves stories, laws, beliefs
      beyond memory. • Receiver: Access to shared culture, norms, and
      rules. • ~1500 CE (printing) • Sender: Reaches many people with
      identical message. • Receiver: Gains access to knowledge at scale.
      • ~1900s • Sender: Produces and stores information quickly. •
      Receiver: Navigates bureaucracy, education, work. • ~2000s–Today •
      Sender: Instant global communication and publication. • Receiver:
      Immediate access to infinite information.</p>
      <p>⸻</p>
      <p>Recorded Speech • 1877 • Sender: Captures exact voice or
      performance once and for all. • Receiver: Re-experiences the same
      voice/performance later. • 1920s–40s • Sender: Broadcasts one
      voice to millions. • Receiver: Shares a real-time spoken
      experience at scale. • 1950s–70s • Sender: Distributes speech
      personally and portably. • Receiver: Learns or consumes speech
      anywhere, anytime. • 2000s • Sender: Publishes speech globally
      without gatekeepers. • Receiver: On-demand speech content (music,
      lectures, podcasts). • 2010s–Today • Sender: Uses voice directly
      to interact with machines. • Receiver: Gets immediate spoken
      responses, guidance, translation.</p>
      <p>⸻</p>
      <p>⚡ Core Distinction: • Text = control + permanence for the
      sender, structured reference + knowledge for the receiver. •
      Speech = expressiveness + immediacy for the sender, experience +
      presence for the receiver.</p>
