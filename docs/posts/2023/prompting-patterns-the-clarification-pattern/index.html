      Patterns: The Clarification Pattern</h1>
      <p>The more I use ChatGPT and develop software using LLM APIs, the
      more I realize that context is essential for LLMs to provide
      high-quality answers. When I use ChatGPT and receive
      unsatisfactory responses, it’s typically due to a lack of
      information about the problem I’m presenting or my current
      situation. I often notice that I might be ambiguous about the task
      I want ChatGPT to address, or ChatGPT perceives the issue in a
      manner I hadn’t anticipated. However, I’ve observed that by
      adopting a simple pattern, I can significantly reduce these
      challenges, consistently leading to more accurate responses.</p>
      <p>I call this the “Clarification Pattern.” Recognizing this
      approach shifted my perspective from viewing prompt engineering
      solely as individual prompts to thinking in terms of human-AI
      conversations. Through these dialogues, I can build valuable
      context by clarifying ambiguities in both my understanding and
      that of ChatGPT, thus providing ChatGPT with the optimal
      conditions to deliver an excellent response.</p>
