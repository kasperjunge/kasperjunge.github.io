      Classifiers are an Underrated Application of LLMs</h1>
      <p>Before LLMs really became a thing, getting up and running with
      a text classifier for a non-standard problem from scratch,
      including the annotation of a dataset for training, would probably
      take at least 3 weeks of work hours. That amounts to 7,200
      minutes. Today, getting up and running with a classifier using
      LLMs requires only writing a prompt, which takes about a
      minute.</p>
      <p>That’s a 7,200x productivity gain in the initial process of
      working with text classifiers.</p>
      <p>One thing to note, however, is that in the 1-minute prompt
      scenario, you have collected zero data and therefore have nothing
      to measure your classifier’s performance against. However, since
      you have a classifier, you can annotate much more efficiently
      using an active learning approach, and you have 7,199 minutes to
      knock yourself out with evaluating your classifier.</p>
      <p>Everybody talks about chatbots and agents as the hot new thing,
      but honestly, a 7,200x productivity gain in text classifier
      development is also pretty huge!</p>
