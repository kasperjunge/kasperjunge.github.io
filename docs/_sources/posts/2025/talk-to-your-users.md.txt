# Talk To Your Users

If you want to win when you build software, practice this one simple thing:

Talk to your users.

You’ll be surprised how few companies actually talk to their users.

It might be the biggest unfair advantage you can get with the smallest possible effort.

You just have to do it.

Talk to your users.

It shouldn’t be an unfair advantage.

But it is.

Because even though everyone should be doing it, no one is doing it.

And actually, you shouldn’t just talk to your users.

You should be obsessed with talking to your users.

Never fool yourself into thinking you know what your users’ problems are.

You don’t.

The only way to learn is by talking to your users.

So talk to your users.
