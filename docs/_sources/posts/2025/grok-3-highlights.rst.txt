Grok 3 Highlights
=================

A couple of days ago `<xAI launched Grok 3 https://x.com/xai/status/1891699715298730482>`_. I wanted to create a short overview for myself of some highlights from the model launch, and I thought I would share it with you as well.

Infrastructure & Data Center Build
----------------------------------
- It took **122 days** to get the first 100,000 GPU data center named **"Colossus"** operational.
- The cluster "Colossus" is described as the **biggest coherently connected H100 cluster** of its kind.
- The data center is housed in an **abandoned Electrolux factory in Memphis**.
- GPUs are **liquid cooled**, requiring extensive plumbing and specialized engineering to achieve the needed density.
- After the initial build, capacity was doubled in a subsequent phase, and a re-engineered data center was completed in just **92 days**.
- A new training cluster with **1.2 gigawatts** of power (roughly 5x the current capacity) is already in development.

Model Training & Performance
----------------------------
- Grok 3 leverages **10x to 15x more compute** compared to the previous generation.
- Pre-training was completed early in January, with the model **continuously receiving daily improvements**.
- On **Chatbot Arena**, an early version of Grok 3 achieved an aggregated **ELO score of 1,400** across multiple categories—setting a new benchmark against competitors.
- There's also a Grok 3 Mini Reasoning version
- Once Grok 3 is stable and mature, there are plans to **open source Grok 2**.

Product Features & Roadmap
--------------------------
- **Big Brain Mode:** Enables the model to allocate additional compute (i.e., more time to think) during test time, boosting problem-solving capabilities.
- **Deep Search:** A new product serving as the first generation of Grok agents, offering next-generation search with integrated verification across multiple sources.
- **Early Access:** Grok 3’s advanced capabilities are initially available to **Premium Plus subscribers on X**.
- **Voice Interaction:** A voice-interactive version is in development. The model will both **understand speech and generate audio responses** directly, with no intermediary speech-to-text / text-to-speech going on.
- **Continuous Enhancements:** Users may notice improvements even within **24 hours**, as the model is updated daily.
