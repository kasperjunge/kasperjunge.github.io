How xAI made the world largest GPU cluster operational in 122 days
===================================================================

In `the Grok 3 launch video at 1:00:05 <https://x.com/xai/status/1891699715298730482>`_, Elon Musk explains how xAI was able to make the world's largest GPU cluster operational in 122 days.

I just wanted to share that specific timestamp with you.

This is a great example of fearless and relentless engineering — driven by raw will and determination to bring an ambitious and technically challenging vision to life.

Know your goal.

Identify the biggest bottleneck, eliminate it, and repeat.

The next time you face a technical challenge that seems impossible to solve — be fearless, believe in yourself, and get to work.
