# Prompting Patterns: The Clarification Pattern - Kasper Junge

The more I use ChatGPT and develop software using LLM APIs, the more I realize that context is essential for LLMs to provide high-quality answers. When I use ChatGPT and receive unsatisfactory responses, it's typically due to a lack of information about the problem I'm presenting or my current situation. I often notice that I might be ambiguous about the task I want ChatGPT to address, or ChatGPT perceives the issue in a manner I hadn't anticipated. However, I've observed that by adopting a simple pattern, I can significantly reduce these challenges, consistently leading to more accurate responses.

I call this the "Clarification Pattern." Recognizing this approach shifted my perspective from viewing prompt engineering solely as individual prompts to thinking in terms of human-AI conversations. Through these dialogues, I can build valuable context by clarifying ambiguities in both my understanding and that of ChatGPT, thus providing ChatGPT with the optimal conditions to deliver an excellent response.
