Things I've learned after 2 years of coding with LLM's
==========================================================

Since the release ChatGPT in late 2022, I have been coding with LLM-based chatbots like ChatGPT, Claude, Le Chat and Gemini, almsot on a daily basis.
In that time, I have learned a lot about what to do and what not to do, in order to get good results.
In this guide, I will share my what I have learned.

Main components for getting good results from LLM's
---------------------------------------------------

Everytime I've gotten an unstatifactory result from a LLM, it can always be traced back to one of these three components:

1. Context
2. Instruction
3. Model capability

Context
~~~~~~~~
One thing to remember about LLM's is that they know nothing about you, your situation and the problem you would like it to solve, unless it present in the prompt you give it.
If you want an LLM to solve a problem for you, you need to provide it with the information that is necessary to solve it.


Instruction

Model capability
