Grok 3 Launch Highlights
========================

A couple of days ago `xAI launched Grok 3 on X <https://x.com/xai/status/1891699715298730482>`_. I wanted to create a short overview for myself of some highlights from the model launch, and I thought I would share it with you as well.



Model
-----
- Grok 3 leverages 10x to 15x more compute compared to the previous generation.
- Pre-training was completed early in January, with the model continuously receiving daily improvements.
- On Chatbot Arena, an early version of Grok 3 achieved an aggregated ELO score of 1,400 across multiple categories—setting a new benchmark against competitors.
- There's also a Grok 3 Mini Reasoning version
- Once Grok 3 is stable and mature, there are plans to open source Grok 2.

Infrastructure
--------------
- It took 122 days to get the 100,000 GPU data center named "Colossus" operational.
- The cluster "Colossus" is described as the biggest coherently connected H100 cluster of its kind.
- The data center is housed in an abandoned Electrolux factory in Memphis.
- GPUs are liquid cooled, requiring extensive plumbing and specialized engineering to achieve the needed density.
- After the initial build, capacity was doubled in a subsequent phase, and a re-engineered data center was completed in just 92 days.
- A new training cluster with 1.2 gigawatts of power (roughly 5x the current capacity) is already in development.

Product
-------
- Big Brain Mode enables the model to allocate additional compute (i.e., more time to think) during test time, boosting problem-solving capabilities.
- Deep Search, a new product serving as the first generation of Grok agents, offering next-generation search with integrated verification across multiple sources.
- Grok 3’s advanced capabilities are initially available to Premium Plus subscribers on X.
- A voice-interactive version is in development. The model will both understand speech and generate audio responses directly, with no intermediary speech-to-text / text-to-speech going on.
- They mentioned that users may notice improvements even within 24 hours, as the model is updated daily.
