# Screw iOS â€” Build Your AI Agent App on SMS

What will be the next big platform for the emerging language interface weâ€™re starting to see with AI agents and standards like [MCP](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol)? ðŸ¤”

Will it be ChatGPT, iOS, Android, Claude, Chrome, or something else?

Actually, we can zoom out even further.

Because the new interface *is* language.

That means anything capable of exchanging text messages or voice can serve as a platform for this new interface.

In principle, you could give iOS the finger and build your AI agent app over SMS and phone calls.
